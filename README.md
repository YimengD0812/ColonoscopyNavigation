### Introduction/Project Aim
AI-Assisted Colonoscopy Navigation — Predicting Insertion Direction

Colonoscopy is a vital tool in the early detection and diagnosis of colorectal diseases. However, navigating the colonoscope through the complex, curved, and often poorly visualized intestinal tract remains a major challenge. During insertion, physicians often face ambiguous views, sharp bends, and limited visibility, increasing procedure time, patient discomfort, and the risk of complications. To address these challenges, we propose an AI-assisted navigation system for colonoscopy, aimed at predicting the optimal insertion direction based on real-time endoscopic imagery.

This system leverages deep learning and image processing techniques to analyze colonoscopic video frames and assist clinicians in guiding the scope more efficiently and safely. The proposed framework consists of multiple modules:

Image Quality Classifier – filters for clear, usable frames suitable for downstream processing;
Dark Region Algorithm – estimates the lumen center in low-texture or ambiguous regions using brightness cues;
Fold Pattern Algorithm – detects visible haustral folds and estimates the lumen path via fold alignment;
Direction Prediction Module – calculates the displacement between the estimated lumen center and the image center to suggest the forward direction of insertion.
By integrating these components, the system provides physicians with real-time visual feedback and navigation suggestions, reducing manual trial-and-error, improving procedural efficiency, and enhancing patient safety. This project aims to pave the way toward intelligent, AI-guided colonoscopy systems that support clinicians in complex endoscopic environments.
